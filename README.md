# Digital Steganography

- Steganography is the practice of hiding information within other non-secret data to ensure its secrecy and security. This technique distinguishes itself from encryption by not just protecting the contents of a message but also concealing the fact that a message exists at all. In the digital realm, steganography entails embedding hidden messages, images, or files within innocuous carrier files such as images, audio files, video files, or text documents.

- Steganography remains an aspect of secure communication, with a rich history and significant contemporary relevance. As the field continues to evolve with advancements in quantum computing and artificial intelligence, the potential for new and more effective steganographic techniques grows. 

- This repository contains algorithms and techniques for steganography, providing methods for embedding data covertly into multimedia files and extracting hidden information without arousing suspicion. By exploring these methods, users can gain insights into the principles of steganography and its applications in digital communication and security.
