Steganography is an intriguing and successful data concealment technology that has been used for centuries. As time progresses, steganography becomes increasingly more important due to cyber security concerns. In the 21st century, cyber attacks have emerged as new methods of warfare against opposing parties, leading to greater adoption of steganography alongside cryptography. Despite this, steganography has been applied for a long time, even during Ancient Greece as described in the seminar paper. Key concepts of digital processing such as spectral transformations like DFT, DCT, DWT, and methods in the spatial domain like LSB, PVD, TPVD, are associated with steganography. In addition to classical digital processing, with the advancement of technology through deep learning and the quantum realm, steganography will undoubtedly become more prevalent in the world.
